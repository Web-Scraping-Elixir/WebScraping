# [Webscraping](https://github.com/Web-Scraping-Elixir)
This project was  develop to learn the functional programming languages and its main features. The project consists of a webscraping that gets the news of three news websites, according to a given topic inserted by the user. The websites used are:
- [G1](https://g1.globo.com/)
- [CNN Brasil](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/)
- [Bloom](https://www.bloomberg.com/)  
  
The project was developed using the Elixir language and its main features are:
- [x] Functional programming.
- [x] Parallelism using Tasks.
- [x] HTTP requests.
- [x] HTML parsing.

## Parallelism using Tasks:
Parallelism is a programming technique that involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks with the aim of improving the performance and efficiency of a program. Instead of executing tasks sequentially, parallelism allows multiple tasks to be executed in parallel, leveraging available resources such as processors or threads to perform processing more quickly. In functional programming, parallelism can be naturally applied due to the characteristics of the language. Functional programming emphasizes data immutability and the absence of side effects, which means that functions have no hidden dependencies and can be executed independently of each other. This property makes it easier to identify parts of the code that can be executed in parallel, as there are no concerns about race conditions or unexpected changes to shared data. Pure functions in functional languages ensure that the result of a function depends only on its arguments, which facilitates dividing the work into smaller and independent tasks. There are several approaches to leverage parallelism in functional languages:

- **Concurrent programming:** It is possible to create independent threads or processes to execute parallel tasks. Each thread or process executes a function in parallel, and the results are combined later.
- **Operations on collections:** Many functional languages provide high-level operations for working with data collections, such as mapping, filtering, and reduction. These operations can be executed in parallel, processing different elements of the collection simultaneously.
- **Asynchronous computation:** In modern functional languages like Elixir or Haskell, there are advanced mechanisms for working with asynchronous and distributed computation. This allows parts of the code to be executed independently and asynchronously, making the most of the available resources.

The parallelism was implemented using the `Task` module, which allows us to create tasks that can be executed in parallel. The `Task` module has two functions: `Task.async` and `Task.await`. The `Task.async` function creates a task that will execute the given function in parallel. The `Task.await` function waits for the result of the given task and returns it. In the implementation of the Web Scraping, this concept is implemnted in the function main, the `Task.async` function is used to create tasks that will execute the functions that get the news of the websites (G1, CNN Brasil and Bloomberg) in parallel, that is to say that each function will be executed in an independent process, once that the execution has started, the code awaits for the end of execution of each function.
Therefore, the parallelism allows that the search of the news in the websites is done in simultaneous, which makes the code more efficient.

## Installation
In order to install Elixir on your machine, follow the official documentation [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
On Unix-based systems with `apt-get` package manager, you can simply run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install elixir -y
```
Also, you need to install de project dependencies located in the `mix.exs` file:
```elixir
mix deps.get
```

## How to run:
Unfortunately, due to the fact the elixir has it's own interactive shell, it's not to automate the execution of the project using Makefile.
So, with that in mind, to run the project, make sure you did the installation steps and then run the following commands:
```elixir  
iex -S mix  
Webscraping.main  
```
After that, the program will ask you to enter a topic and then it will print the news of the three websites related to the topic you entered.

## Elixir Great Features:
- **Functional Programming:** Elixir is a functional programming language, which means that it focuses on the evaluation of expressions rather than execution of commands. In other words, it is a declarative language, which means that it focuses on what to solve rather than how to solve it.
- **Imutability:** Elixir is immutable, which means that once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This is a great feature because it makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **High-order functions:** Elixir supports high-order functions, which means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and functions can return other functions as results. Examples: `Enum.map/2`, `Task.async`, `Task.await`.
- **Pure functions:** Elixir functions are pure, which means that they do not have side effects. This is a great feature because it makes the code more predictable and easier to debug. Examples: `IO.puts`, `get_g1/1`, `get_cnn_brasil/1` e `get_bloom/1`.
- **Concurrency:** Elixir supports concurrency, which means that it can run multiple processes at the same time. This is a great feature because it makes the code more efficient and easier to debug.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Elixir supports object-oriented programming, which means that it can use objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. This is a great feature because it makes the code more reusable and easier to debug.
- **Easy Syntax:** Elixir has a very easy syntax, which means that it is easy to learn and use. This is a great feature because it makes the code more readable and easier to debug. For example, private methods are defined using the `defp` keyword, which makes it easy to identify them.


## Functions:
- `IO.puts` - IO.puts(text) - Prints the given text to the console.
- `ÃŒO.gets` - IO.gets() - Reads a line from the console.
- `Enum.map/2` - Enum.map(collection, fun) - Returns a new list with fun applied to each entry in the collection.
- `Task.async` - Task.async(fun) - Starts a new task that will invoke fun and return its result as a Task struct immediately.
- `Task.await` - Task.await(task) - Awaits the result of a task and returns it.
- `HTTPoison.get` - HTTPoison.get(url) - Performs a GET request to the given url.
- `Floki.find` - Floki.find(html, selector) - Returns the first element in the html that matches the given selector.
- `Floki.text` - Floki.text(html) - Returns the text content of the given html.
- `Floki.attribute` - Floki.attribute(html, attribute) - Returns the value of the given attribute in the html.
- `Crawly.fetch` - Crawly.fetch(url) - Fetch ther request for a specified URL.
